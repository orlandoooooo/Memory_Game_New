Plan for mental mini cheat (next game?)

intro, splash, title, etc.
menu: rules or start
deal hands
show hands
    "warning - will now show player 1"
    player 1 hand
    "warning - will now show player 2"
    player 2 hand
choose first player (random)
    "first player is ____"
    store current player as variable
# 1 turn
while True:
    # for current player
    # if playing regular cheat:
        choose cards from hand (allow only cards from hand)
        choose declaration (allow any cards)
    # for mental mini cheat, allow any input, but check if player thinks they are cheating
        choose cards from hand (do not display hand - allow any cards)
        choose declaration (allow any cards)
    if chosen cards are not in hand, player cheated/forgot and picks up cards
        forgot = True
        player.forgot_count += 1
        jump check win (or skip code using 'forgot = True' variable)
    update variable cheated
    place cards and remove cards from hand
    (else: turn) <- if using label
    # switch current player
    # probably unnecessary condition (cards always in pile)
    if cards in pile:
        # check if declare cheat
        menu:
            cheat
            no cheat
        store cheated = True/False
        if said cheat:
            # check if cheated
            reveal if cheated or not
            if cheated:
                display warning and show cards to not current player
                dealing (not-current) player picks up
                lost_cheat and/or won_cheat variables = ? player
            else:
                display warning and show cards to current player
                non-dealing (current) player picks up
                lost_cheat and/or won_cheat variables = ? player
        decide next current player
            # option 1: player do not change current player
            # option 2: base current player on if cheated or not
                # option 1: player who picked up (lost the cheat) plays
                    if cheated, current player is lost_cheat
                    else current player doesn't change
                # option 2: player who didn't pick up plays
                    if cheated, current player is won_cheat
                    else current player doesn't change
            # option 3: if called_cheat and cheated:
                player who didn't pick up plays
                if cheated, current player is won_cheat
    (if renpy: jump win)
    # check_win
    if one player hand empty:
        they are winner
        reveal winner
        reveal hands
        reveal both players' forgot_count
        jump menu
    (if renpy: jump turn)
